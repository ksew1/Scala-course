# My Scala Course Repository for AGH UST 📚

Hey there! Welcome to my personal GitHub repository for the Scala course at AGH UST 🚀. Here I keep all the materials related to the course, including lecture slides, code samples, and my assignments.

## Repository Structure 📁

The repository is organized into several folders, each corresponding to a specific module of the course.

## My Progress 🏆

I'll be keeping track of my progress through the course by creating branches for each module and making commits as I complete the assignments and exercises. I'm excited to see how my skills in Scala grow throughout the course! 🌱

I'm looking forward to a great semester of learning Scala! 👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
